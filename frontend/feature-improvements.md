# Features to Implement

These things are nice to have but should not be worked on before we have finished making an MVP.

## Code Editor

The code editor is not properly implemented.

It loads in a hacky way. Probably it is not tree shook.

It does not have auto complement and throws a bunch of errors to the console.

Auto Scroll up so that user can look at the submission after they submit.
